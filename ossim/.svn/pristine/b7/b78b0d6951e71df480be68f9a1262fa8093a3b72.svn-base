// Also, to make cross-project references work well, we define a common build folder for this project.  This causes all targets of all projects that are based on this .xcconfig file to have access to each other's built products.  It's also a good idea to set the build folder to a folder on the local hard disk, if the project sources live on a network-mounted file system.
